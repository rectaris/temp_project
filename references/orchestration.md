# Orchestration

The main agent owns interpretation, final integration, validation acceptance, planning updates, and commits.

## Helper Roles

- `repo_explorer`: read-only file discovery and impact analysis.
- `scoped_worker`: bounded implementation with explicit write scope.
- `change_reviewer`: read-only correctness, regression, validation, and security review.
- `docs_researcher`: read-only external or version-specific research.

## Delegation Rules

- Delegate only concrete, bounded, independently useful work.
- Assign non-overlapping write scopes.
- Keep final judgment in the main session.
- Treat helper output as advisory until accepted through validation.
- Use durable handoff files only for cross-session transfer or staged work.
- Keep repeated helper prompt templates under `docs/plan/sub-agents/` when a project needs them.
- Use deterministic Stop hooks only as review prompts; they do not replace validation.

## Cost Gate

Use local execution for tightly coupled, urgent, or small work. Use helpers when context pressure, file size, semantic risk, or review value outweighs coordination cost.

## Optional External Services

MCP, Linear, graph memory, and external CLIs should be modeled as opt-in modules. For each workflow, document whether operations are dry-run, read-capable, or write-capable. External writes require explicit user intent or a documented lifecycle command.

Generated repositories should use `docs/agent/SPEC_EXTERNAL_SERVICES.md` as the integration guide. It should name the credential source, connection metadata, write-capable commands, local fallback, and review boundary for each enabled service. Disabled services should still explain what must be added before the service can become required.
